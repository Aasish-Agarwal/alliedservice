=============

A boquet of services that individuals &amp; business can leverage to serve the community better

## Roots
As I am having to visit my doctor fairly regularly I saw an opportunity to do better by observing crowded waiting area and waiting time

While it was easy for me to put togather a simple website, I thought about turning into to an opportunity for all likeminded people to serve the community better.

## Plan
I dont really have a clear plan except start working on it. However at a marco level I am going to follow these steps
* Create a service acceptance document
* Develop the service artifacts
* Deploy and test on test site
* Tag it after succesfull acceptance test execution 
* Deploy tagged services in production installation

## Sites
* Test
* Production

## Architecture
This project will evolve as a set of independent services, independent means that the development, testing, deployment, upgrades etc all will be independent of other services.

Evolution of a service will not dependent on other services.

## Source Structure
* All services are placed under services folder
* Each service will be deployed as a full fledged site
* Each service has following mendatory folders
    * public_html
    *  acceptance
